NAME
       format   - file formats of the LSN (low-level net)

Grammar:

         .lsn               ::= <pl><tr><arc><nnmu><nst><arcdesc>^k <M>^l
          pl                ::= m
          tr                ::= n
         arc                ::= k
         nnmu               ::= l
         nst                ::= NST
        arcdesc             ::= v1 v2 w
          M                 ::= p mu 
           
  Notes:
      1) m n k l NST

          m - number of places, n - number of transitions, k - number of arcs, l - number of nonzero markings, NST - number of substitution transition

          If NST = 0, it is LSN.

          If NST > 0 , it is HSN.

       2) arcdesc:

          Case 1: If v1 < 0, v2 < 0, arc from transition v1 to transition v2. It is a priority arc with w = 0.

          Case 2: If v1 > 0, v2 > 0, arc from place v1 to transition v2 of multiplicity w.
        
          Case 3: If v1 < 0, v2 > 0, arc from transition v2 to place |v1| of multiplicity w.
       
          Case 4: When w is negative, it is inhibitor arc.

       3) Marking line:

            p - place number, mu - marking value

       4) Each line that starts from ';', it considers as a comment.
