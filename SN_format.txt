       format   - file formats of the SN (low-level net)

Grammar:

         .lsn              ::= <pl><tr><arc><arcdesc>^k
          pl               ::= m
          tr                ::= n
         arc               ::= k
        arcdesc         ::= v1 v2 w
           
  Notes:
      
      Case 1: If v1 < 0, v2 < 0, arc from transition v1 to transition v2. It is a priority arc with w = 0.

      Case 2: If v1 > 0, v2 > 0, arc from place v1 to transition v2 of multiplicity w.
       
      Case 3: If v1 < 0, v2 > 0, arc from transition v2 to place |v1| of multiplicity w.
       
      Case 4: When w is negative, it is inhibitor arc.
